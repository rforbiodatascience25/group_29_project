## Introduction

```{r}
#| include: false

library("tidyverse")

data_aug <- read_csv(here::here("data/data_aug.csv"))

summary <- data_aug |>   
  summarise(n_CDs = n_distinct(CD),   
            n_celltypes = n_distinct(cell_type))

```

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%" style="font-size:50%"}
-   CD molecules are membrane proteins with diverse functions and distributions across immune cell types.

-   Their expression patterns help distinguish cell lineages and reveal functional relationships

**Aim:**

-   How do the expression of CD markers on lymphocyte subsets change during maturation?

-   How are fluorescence intensity, variability, and positivity (MedQb, CVQb, PEpos) related across CD markers in lymphocyte subsets?

**Data from:**

-   Frontiers in Immunology, “B Cell Biology,” vol. 10, Oct. 23, 2019. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2019.02434

-   Can be downloaded from their shiny app: <http://bioinformin.cesnet.cz/CDmaps/>

## Materials and Methods

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%" style="font-size:50%"}
-   **The data set contains:**

    -   `r nrow(data_aug)` observations of `r ncol(data_aug)` variables

    -   `r summary |> pluck("n_CDs")` unique CDs and `r summary |> pluck("n_celltypes")` unique cell types

-   **Selected variables:**

    -   CVQB, MedQb and PEpos

**Sample of data_aug:**

```{r}

  slice_sample(n = 5)

## PCA of MedQb and PEpos

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%" style="font-size:50%"}
-   **MedQb:**
    -   Three distinct clusters
    -   Thymocytes cluster with T-cells from blood
    -   B-cells form a tonsil cluster and a blood cluster
-   **PEpos:**
    -   Four distinct clusters
    -   Thymocytes and blood T cells are seperated in two clusters
    -   B-cells from blood and tonsil seperate in PC2, but very similar in PC1

## Overview of CD markers

::: {.columns style="font-size:50%"}
-   Wide variations in CD marker distribution

-   **Tissue-related** clusters are common

-   Some markers are universally expressed (e.g. CD45), with others are **lineage-specific**

![](images/06_key_plot.png)
:::

## How does MedQb correlate with CVQb and PEpos?

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%" style="font-size:50%"}
**CVQb:**

-   Blue lines show a negative correlation → higher CVQb = lower MedQb

-   Tonsil B cells: line is flat → almost no relationship

**PEpos:**

-   Pink lines show a positive correlation → higher PEpos = higher MedQb

## How does CD expression change during maturation?

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%" style="font-size:50%"}
-   For each tissue and lineage, a linear model was applied with the naive cell as the reference

![](images/compare_Bnaive.png){fig-align="center" width="456"}
:::

::: {.column width="50%" style="font-size:50%"}
-   B cells had the most significant markers, showing stronger activation changes

![](images/08_key_plot_1.png)
:::
:::::

## How does CD expression change during maturation?

::: {.columns style="font-size:50%"}
-   Tonsil B cells are more activated (CD69, CD80), while blood B cells mature gradually (CD11a, CD80)

-   CD4 and CD8 T cells follow a similar pattern. Develop in the thymus and become more specialized and mature in the blood.

## How do CD markers differ between CD4 and CD8 T cells?

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%" style="font-size:50%"}
-   CD4 and CD8 T cells go through parallel stages

    ![](images/CD4vsCD8.png)

-   SP1am and naive subsets have the lowest number of significant CDs → CD4 and CD8 more similar in CD expression in these stages

:::::

## How do CD markers differ between CD4 and CD8 T cells?

::: {.columns style="font-size:50%"}
-   As expected CD4 and CD8 are significant different for all pairs

-   CD59 is significant for all stages except TEMRA with a higher log(MedQb) for CD4 T cells

## Discussion

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%" style="font-size:50%"}
**Why did we choose the linear model to assess significant difference for CDs?**

-   Simple method to compare each subset to the naive cell

-   An ANOVA could for example also have been used for pairwise comparison

![](images/lm_vs_ANOVA.png)
:::

::: {.column width="50%" style="font-size:50%"}
**Problems with missing values in the wide-format data set for PCA**

-   Number of experiments for each CD differed → summarized the experiments by the mean

-   Not every CD marker was measured across all cell types → replaced the missing value with the median for that specific CD

-   Limits the variation in the data set, but necessary to avoid dropping observations
