## Introduction

-   CD molecules are membrane proteins with diverse functions and distributions across immune cell types.

-   Their expression patterns help distinguish cell lineages and reveal functional relationships

**The aim of our project was to answer the questions:**

-   How do the expression of CD markers on lymphocyte subsets change during maturation?

-   How are fluorescence intensity, variability, and positivity (MedQb, CVQb, PEpos) related across CD markers in lymphocyte subsets?

**CVQb:**

-   Blue lines show a negative correlation → higher CVQb = lower MedQb

-   Tonsil B cells: line is flat → almost no relationship

**PEpos:**

-   Pink lines show a positive correlation → higher PEpos = higher MedQb
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Wide variations in CD marker distribution.
-   **Tissue-related** clusters are common
-   Some markers are universally expressed (e.g. CD45), while others are **lineage-specific**.

## Analysis 4

::::: columns

-   **Table:** B cells had the most significant markers, showing stronger activation changes.

-   **B cells:** Tonsil B cells are more activated (CD69, CD80), while blood B cells mature gradually (CD11a, CD80).

-   **CD4 T cells:** Mature from thymus to blood, losing CD10 and gaining CD25 and CD4_MEM-241.

-   **CD8 T cells:** Move from active thymus cells to mature blood cells with higher CD27 and CD95.

## Analysis 5

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%" style="font-size:50%"}
-   CD4 and CD8 T cells go through parallel stages

    ![](images/CD4vsCD8.png)

-   **How do the CD markers differ between CD4 and CD8 T cells for each stage?**

    -   As expected CD4 and CD8 are significant different for all pairs
    -   CD59 is significant for all stages except TEMRA with a higher log(MedQb) for CD8
    -   SP1am and Naive have the lowest number of significant CDs → CD4 and CD8 more similar in these stages
