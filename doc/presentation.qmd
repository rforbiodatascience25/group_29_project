-   CD4 and CD8 T cells go through parallel stages
-   How do the CD markers differ between CD4 and CD8 T cells for each stage?
    -   As expected CD4 and CD8 are significant different for all pairs
    -   CD59 is significant for all stages except TEMRA with a higher log(MedQb) for CD8
    -   SP1am and Naive have the lowest number of significant CDs → CD4 and CD8 more similar in these stages
